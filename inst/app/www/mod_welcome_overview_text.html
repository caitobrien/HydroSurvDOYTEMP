<p>Chinook Salmon and Steelhead may have decreased survival and endure experiences through the hydroelectric power system as they migrate downstream the Snake and Columbia rivers (Pacific Northwest) towards the ocean. The US Army Corps of Engineers runs the Juvenile Fish Transportation Program to help mitigate decreases in smolt-to-adult-return (SAR) survival going downstream, in the ocean, and back to the river.</p>
<p>One way to assess the effectiveness of the transportation program is through the SAR survival ratio of fish that were transported to that of fish bypassed (T:B) through the dams and therefore migrating in-river through the hydrosystem.</p>
<div style='text-align: center; margin: auto;'>
<ul style='display: inline-block; text-align: left;'>
 <li>T:B = 1 would indicate a neutral effect of transportation on SAR survival.</li>
 <li>T:B > 1 would indicate a benefit of transportation, and</li>
 <li>T:B < 1 would represent a negative effects of transportation on SAR survival.</li>
</ul>

<p>Understanding which underlying experiences may affect the T:B ratio and thereby improve survival of migratory fishes is useful for management decisions such as water temperature control, when to transport fish, and annual spill rates. Scheuerell et al. (2009) and Gosselin et al. (2018) both consider the effects of freshwater experiences on survival, with the former highlighting the importance of migration timing, and the latter further investigating the difference of transported versus fish migrating in-river.</p>
<p>Scheuerell et al. (2009) found that date of arrival in the estuary for natural-origin chinook and steelhead, while varying by year, was an indicator of juveniles surviving to maturity, with early to mid-May having higher survival than later migration in mid-June. Increased springtime river flows or water spilled to expedite transit through the hydrosystem were suggested management options to increase early arrival times to the estuary.</p>
<p>Gosselin et al. (2018) using a similar model approach, found that survival associated with carryover effects of juvenile freshwater and marine experiences differ between hatchery- and natural-origin Chinook, as well as, transported versus fish migrating in-river. Such that hatchery fish benefitted from transportation through the migration season, especially in warm PDO years, whereas transportation was detrimental to early season natural-origin chinook, unless in cooler PDO years.</p>
<p>While the differences pose a challenge to management decisions, such as when to transport and which rear type to preference in those decisions, Gosselin et al. (2018) did find higher survival with increased river flow, high predation in the estuary and plume areas, and faster migration and development- related increased survival with temperature.</p>
<p>This application has adapted both models in a Bayesian framework to provide access to the research findings and allow adjustments based on usersâ€™ individual needs to better understand and explore the underlying hypothesis and models. Through this application, the user is also able to compare model predictions to observations, providing a sense of model skill.</p>
