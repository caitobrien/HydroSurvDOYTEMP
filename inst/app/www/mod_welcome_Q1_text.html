<p>This application showcases predicted survival for Chinook salmon, <em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>, and Steelhead, <em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>,
influenced by seasonal changes experienced during downstream migration through the Federal Columbia River Power System Hydrosystem (FCRPS) (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This application allows users to explore two metrics of interests used to determine the effectiveness of FCRPS transportation program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smolt-to-Adult Return survival (SAR),</li>
<li>and Transported to Bypassed fish survival ratio (T:B).</li>
</ul>
